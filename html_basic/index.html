    <h1>My First Heading On Nutrition</h1>
    <p>Combinations of these patterns may also be used to describe organisms.
        Higher plants, for example, are photolithotrophic; i.e., they utilize light
        energy, with the inorganic compound water serving as the ultimate electron
        donor. Certain photosynthetic bacteria that cannot utilize water as the
        electron donor and require organic compounds for this purpose are called
        photoorganotrophs. Animals, according to this classification, are
        chemoorganotrophs; i.e., they utilize chemical compounds to supply energy
        and organic compounds as electron donors.

    <p>Nutrition, the assimilation by living organisms of food materials that enable 
        them to grow, maintain themselves, and reproduce.

    <h2>My Second Heading On Nutrition</h2>
    <p>Nevertheless, general patterns can be discerned in the nutritional process
        throughout the living world and in the types of nutrients that are required
        to sustain life. These pattjerns are the subject of this article. For a
        full discussion of the nutritional requirements of humans in particular,
        see the article nutrition, human.

    <h3>My Third Heading on Nutrition</h3>
    <p>In one scheme, organisms are classified according to the energy source
        they utilize. Phototrophic, or photosynthetic, organisms trap light
        energy and convert it to chemical energy, whereas chemoautotrophic,
        or chemosynthetic, organisms utilize inorganic or organic compounds to
        supply their energy requirements.
