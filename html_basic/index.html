            <h1>My First Heading On Nutrition</h1>
            <p>Combinations of these patterns may also be used to describe organisms.
                Higher plants, for example, are photolithotrophic; i.e., they utilize light
                energy, with the inorganic compound water serving as the ultimate electron
                donor. Certain photosynthetic bacteria that cannot utilize water as the
                electron donor and require organic compounds for this purpose are called
                photoorganotrophs. Animals, according to this classification, are
                chemoorganotrophs; i.e., they utilize chemical compounds to supply energy
                and organic compounds as electron donors.
            </p>
            <p>Nutrition, the assimilation by living organisms of food materials that enable 
                them to grow, maintain themselves, and reproduce.
            </p>
            <h2>My Second Heading On Nutrition</h2>
            <p>Nevertheless, general patterns can be discerned in the nutritional process
                throughout the living world and in the types of nutrients that are required
                to sustain life. These pattjerns are the subject of this article. For a
                full discussion of the nutritional requirements of humans in particular,
                see the article nutrition, human.

            <h3>My Third Heading on Nutrition</h3>
            <p>In one scheme, organisms are classified according to the energy source
                they utilize. Phototrophic, or photosynthetic, organisms trap light
                energy and convert it to chemical energy, whereas chemoautotrophic,
                or chemosynthetic, organisms utilize inorganic or organic compounds to
                supply their energy requirements.
